# `reverse_video_cursor_min_contrast = 2.5`

{{since('nightly')}}

The minimum contrast ratio required to use the reverse video cursor.

When the contrast ratio between the reverse video cursor foreground and
background is below this threshold then the default cursor foreground and
background will be used instead.
